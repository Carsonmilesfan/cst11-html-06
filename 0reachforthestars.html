[Kendrick Lamar:]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[SZA:]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothing new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsing?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealing with
A small percentage who I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning
On my mama, that's the realest shit

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[SZA:]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Skin covered in ego
Get to talking like ya involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, got no ways out, got to stay down
It's the way that you making me feel
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
You kinda feel like you're tryna get away from me
If you do, I won't move
I ain't just cry for no reason, I ain't just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathing
I did it all 'cause it feel good
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we're running out of time

[Kendrick Lamar & SZA:]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for? (Ooh)
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[SZA:]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
